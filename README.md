# machineLearning
My first attempt at machine learning. This windows forms app will, given a description of one of a selection of subjects, guess as to which subject was being described. The user can feedback and the program will associate the text with that subject by saving the words to a text file. It's currently configured for the subjects: animals, machines, buildings. Main code is in Form1.cs
